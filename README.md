# How to use?
If you have an HTML5 video playing on any website like Youtube just press the PiPifier icon in Safari's toolbar to enable Picture-In-Picture for this video. Make sure you did interact with the video player once before pressing (like play/pause).

#Installation
(0. Launch PiPifier)<br />
1. Open Safari and go to Preferences<br />

3. Enable PiPifier (If you don't see PiPifier and you built the app by yourself you need to sign it or choose Developer -> Allow unsigned extensions)<br />

#Note for developers
The code is a bit dirty and there are some unused parts in it (Tried to add more features before I needed to focus on other things). If you want to help me clean it up feel free to do so :)
