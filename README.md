(0. Launch PiPifier)<br />

## Why?
There are many sites that avoids you using iOS default video controls (YouTube for example) so you can't enable PiP mode. PiPifier lets you enable PiP regardless those limitations.

For developement: Xcode 8

## Installation
1. Open Safari<br />
2. Open the Share Menu<br />
3. Choose More<br />
4. Enable 'Run PiPifier'<br />
5. Select 'Run PiPifier' on a website with a video

# How can I help?
If you are a developer feel free to make any addition to improve PiPifier.

If you are user and want a native PiP button in any video player please make a request in the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/arnoappenzeller/PiPifier/issues/12)

# Note for developers
The code is a bit dirty and there are some unused parts in it (Tried to add more features before I needed to focus on other things). If you want to help me clean it up feel free to do so :)
